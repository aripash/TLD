unity to do:
try to draw lanes, traffic light for that lane and traffic density.[x](we use premade maps)

build set amount of junctions and let the user pick densities.[v]

to draw a lane you "click" a starting point and an end point and the program will draw a line with direction,
then it will update the constraint list.[x](we use premade maps)

add user parameters.[v]

after drawing a lane the program needs to add a traffic light automaticly.[x](we use premade maps)

draw on the lane if its open.[x]

constraint: 
road has at least 1 lane, each lane has 1 traffic light, each traffic light has at least 1 lane.[v]

if 2 lanes intersect, both trafficlights cant be open(pairs of lanes that cant be opened together).[v]

logic:
lanes that are divided by multuple traffic lights(combine them into one big lane with multiple traffic lights with the
combined density or to seperate it to multiple lanes that are connected by giving the density from one lane to another
if one of the lanes are open).




if 2 paraller roads are touching, we dont want to add a constraint.[v](we use premade maps)
make to paraller roads that face the same direction combine.[x](we use premade maps)

fix: curved road, draw big roads[v]


car raycast forward and if it sees a car tag less then "1m" away, stop.(make on update)[v]


after each cycle to resend new densities.[x](we use time to determain a cycle)

cycle param can be changed by the user.[v]

draw more maps.(T junction)[v]

number of changes in one cycle. [v]

time for each change in a cycle. [v]

part2->addRoad->numOfRoads++(fix it) [v]

cycles wont change when you change thier timer [logicly OK]

delay between lights switchs (yellow light)[v]

more and better comments (///)[v]

complete UI[v]

make a main menu[v]

part2 change from update to coroutine and add to part 4[v]

change the map to not have right turns[v]

add genetics to the algo[x](not enough time)

a lot of testing[v]
