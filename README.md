# Traffic Lights Decider

Traffic simulation based on our algorithm for traffic lights distribution.

Developed with Unity Version: 2019.f.0f1

Final project part of B.Sc in Ariel University

# Main idea

Traffic is one of the influential concepts nowadays: economy, health, pollution, mental health, time and more all subjected to traffic efficiency.

Therefore it is very important that the roads be in the most efficient condition, as junctions are one of the main causes of delays and traffic jams which is our main focus for releasing the congestion on the roads.

We aim for the 'TLD' traffic light algorithm we are developing to be a solution to efficient real-time traffic light distribution. The system today is largely built from statistics methods and not sufficiently affected by real-time information, so on the road many drivers lose precious time that can be dragged into hours of wasted time.

Our algorithm should be efficient enough to handle information and calculation in real time.
